Superbowl History

Introductory: 
This is my project for the conclusion of my course in certificate in Introductory Data Analysis.
I decided to dedicate my project based on this historic American football competition as it is a topic that I find very interesting and being an avid National Football League fan I feel that I could have great interest and enjoyment diving into the data associated with this competition.
